            During my stay of four years in ABES-EC, I am thankful to all the teachers who supported us and corrected us throughout our bachelors and the classes are very interactive and also faculties ensure that every student understands what is being taught before proceeding

            I have received a great support from placement cell for providing a platform to enhance my skills. The Institute's library serves as the ultimate answer to all our queries in terms of number of books, papers and periodicals. The infrastructure of the college speaks for itself. I am carrying beautiful memories along with me of this place and will always cherish them.
